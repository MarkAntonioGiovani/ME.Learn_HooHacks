# ME.Learn_HooHacks
Attendance on HooHacks 2021
Initial repo is: https://github.com/MarkAntonioGiovani/MELearn
Since we got some problems with git and ran out of time we needed to open a new repository.


## Inspiration
In an era where nearly everyone owns a smartphone, the popularity of learning apps is growing fast. We wanted to build an application that helps learning with a daily routine.

## What it does
ME.Learn is a index card learning application. Simply create new decks and add index cards. 

## How we built it
We were using **Android Studio** as IDE to build the application's functionality with **Java** and create the UI. First we built the UI and added functionality to buttons and other UI elements. After we had fundamental functionality we added a cloud database.
For the database aspect we were using the **Cloud Firestone by Firebase, Google**. We were using it to save user account information (register, login), created decks and the created cards within the decks.

## Challenges we ran into
We spent a lot of time getting information about how Android Studio and Firebase works. Since it is our first built application we didn't had any knowledge about it. We spent many hours to get the database working and also the data flow between the different fragments. 
Living in germany we needed to code throughout the night which resulted in a lack of concentration.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We built an application with tools that we didn't know before. We are proud to have learned so much about different topics like UI, cloud database and android application development.

## What we learned
Since it was the first Hackathon for everyone of us, we learned a few things for the next one.
- time management
- Firebase
- Android Studio UI and programming aspects

## What's next for ME.Learn
Many features are missing in this state of development. We are planning to add the following:
- Learning mode: memory game - you need to combine your indexcards as they lay down with others.
- Social: Friendlist (adding friends) and the possibility to challenge your friends with your decks
- Achievements: Earning achievements connected to the users activity
- Groups: aspect for an integration in school classes. Class teacher can create groups and hand in an vocabulary test.
- Dark mode: Fully functional darkmode
- Settings: Choose font size, dark/light mode
- Forget password
